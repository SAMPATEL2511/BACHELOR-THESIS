## 📖 Project Overview

This project explores a bladeless wind turbine concept that leverages **vortex-induced vibrations** (Kármán vortex street phenomenon) to convert wind energy into electricity without using traditional rotating blades. The goal was to create a low-cost, compact, and safer alternative to HAWTs and VAWTs.

## 🔬 Abstract (From Report)

The bladeless wind turbine generates electricity using vortex-induced vibrations instead of blades. It comprises a flexible mast, spring-mounted base, and a linear alternator setup. When wind hits the mast, it oscillates, and this motion is transferred to generate electricity via copper coils and neodymium magnets. The system is quiet, safe, cost-effective, and ideal for low-power, localized electricity generation.

## 🧪 Working Principle

- Wind hits the **mast**, creating **oscillations** (like a pendulum).
- Oscillations transfer motion to a **horizontal shaft** with springs.
- A **vibrating mechanism** uses copper coil + neodymium magnets to produce AC voltage.
- Output is demonstrated using **LEDs**.
